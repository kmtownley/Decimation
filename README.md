# Decimation

##Sample JS Project Proposal

### About 
  Decimals...Fruit...what more could you ask for in a game. Tapping into the gamification trend in education, Decimation is a one play game that not only tests your knowledge of decimal places but also your slicing skills. A decimal value will appear in written notation at the top of the playing field, and depending on the level of the game, peices of fruit will fly at you with various decimal numbers. You slice the fruit when you find the matching number.  
  
### Functionality & MVP

Decimation will allows users to:
  -Start, Pause, Stop and restart a game 
  -Gain seeds by slicing open the correct fruits
  -Earb a spot on the leader board
  -Level up to increase both the difficult of the numbers and the speed of the fruit
